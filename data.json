        "details":"JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive content on web applications and browsers.The answer: JavaScript is more difficult to master than Python. Python is usually the beginners-choice, especially for those who do not have any prior programming experience. Python code is notorious for being more readable, meaning that it is easier to understand (and write).S2PY works by translating JavaScript directly into Python. It indicates that you may run JS directly from Python code without installing large external engines like V8. To use the module it first has to be installed into the system, since it is not built-in."
